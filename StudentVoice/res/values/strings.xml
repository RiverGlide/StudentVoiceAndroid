    StudentVoice enables prospective and current University students to 
    locate Uni’s, local attractions and view public reviews about a Univeristy.\n\n
    
    Created during CDI Europe’s Apps For Good course, this version of the App 
    represents what we were able to achieve with only 3 hours a day for 4 weeks,
