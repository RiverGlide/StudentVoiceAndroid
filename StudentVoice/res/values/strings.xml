    StudentVoice (Preview Edition) enables prospective and current university students to 
    locate Universities, read reviews and explore local attractions.
    Currently, only London is supported.\n\n
    
    This is our first attempt at software development. Created during CDI Europeâ€™s 
    pilot Apps For Good course and guided by Antony Marcano of RiverGlide, 
    this was implemented in 3 hours a day over 3 and a half weeks. 
    Future updates include writing your own reviews, social network integration
     and coverage of all UK universities.\n\n
