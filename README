Apps for Good Project: StudentVoice

Apps for Good is run by CDI Europe. Antony Marcano of RiverGlide mentored  
Carlos Mateus, Moses Sonson and Matthew Tanti through learning about the 
Android SDK to create the beginnings of an App idea they had.

This project is the beginnings of a learning process that we hope the guys
will continue, even after the project is completed.
