Apps for Good Project: StudentVoice

    StudentVoice enables prospective and current university students in London to 
    locate Uni’s, local attractions and view public reviews about a univeristy.
    
    This is our first attempt at software development. Created during CDI Europe’s 
    pilot Apps For Good course and guided by Antony Marcano of RiverGlide, 
    this was implemented in 3 hours a day over 3 weeks (so far). 
    Our future vision includes writing your own reviews, social network integration
     and coverage of all UK universities.
